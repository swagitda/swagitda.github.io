  - Reading List

As I [wrote about last year](/blog/posts/2016-reading-list), my ongoing New Year’s resolution is to try to read one non-fiction and one fiction book per month. I was unable to fully accomplish this goal for 2017 (I tend to gravitate more towards fiction in tumultuous times), but I loved the books I did manage to read along the way.

In the vein of last year’s post, I sought out non-fiction and science / speculative fiction books by a diverse set of authors. While last year I aimed to discover as many new female authors as possible, this year I specifically strove to experience sci-fi from other cultural perspectives and underrepresented voices, as well as learn more about the history of non-Western civilizations.

My reading list is below, including links to each book’s Amazon page if you’d like to check them out. There were no “thumbs down” books I read this year, and I’m bad at book reviews anyway, so I’ll leave judgement up to y’all.

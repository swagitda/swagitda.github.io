My perennial New Year’s resolution is to read one fiction and one non-fiction book per month. I tend to fail, and this year I only averaged 1.33 books per month (which, interestingly, is the same as last year; 2016 was 1.5 per month).

As you can tell from this list, I became a bit obsessed with [afrofuturism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrofuturism) and am still in awe of the immersive worldbuilding within the genre’s novels I read. I gravitated more towards fiction this year in general, which meant I snuck in fewer non-fiction books than usual (I did read more academic papers this year, but they’re far more arid).

If you’re looking for more science fiction, speculative fiction, or non-fiction recommendations, check out [my 2017](/blog/posts/2017-reading-list) and [my 2016](/blog/posts/2016-reading-list) reading lists.

      <title>When Prospect Theory Meets Chaos Engineering</title>

However, it is a connection I believe is worth illuminating.
Adopting the “chaotic infosec” philosophy (the application of chaos engineering to information security) can influence those who build and secure systems to operate more like attackers – that is, to be more risk averse and to more quickly update their mental models given new inputs.</description>
